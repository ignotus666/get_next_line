To submit bonuses for your project,
you must include a bonus rule in your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, 
libraries, or functions that are not allowed in
the main part of the project. 
Bonuses must be placed in _bonus.{c/h} files, 
unless the subject specifies otherwise. 
The evaluation of mandatory and 
bonus parts is conducted separately.
